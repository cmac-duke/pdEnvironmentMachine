This patch (main.pd) uses live microphone feedback and will accumulate quickly and dangerously if monitored through speakers! Each [piMachine3] object takes global live mic input and writes its own (unique/distinct) one-second buffer, while simulataneouls writing to a larger, global five-second buffer. The [bufferLoop] objects access the global buffer at various points. The [piMachine3] objects' individual buffers aren't heard directly;
only the [bufferLoop] objects send signal to the output. So we're hearing X # of [piMachine3] buffers and their feedback loops collapsed into a global buffer.
